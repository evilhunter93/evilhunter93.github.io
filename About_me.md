<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
¡Hola! ¡Me llamo Kevin! Or my name's Kevin, in English! I'm a guy/developer born in '93 and raised in the southern parts of Sweden
with a guitar in one hand and a keyboard/controller in another. Music and games have always been my core interests, 
and as such, I spend a lot of time playing things! The developer part might seem the obvious next step to take from games, but it was
one I really first took when I entered Lunds Technical Highschool (a university in the city of Lund, Sweden).
</p>
<p>
After getting a taste of programming however, I quickly came to enjoy it as tackling diverse and exciting
problems with logic as the key was extremely appealing to me. Over the years, I've dabbled in many different languages,
whether that be Java, Python, C, C++, C#, Haskell and several others. Of course I've also dabbled in Swedish, English and Spanish,
though I'm especially proficient in Swedish and English.
</p>
<p>
As a person I would say that I believe that being open to others, both in discussion and in general, as well as doing what you enjoy
is what allows you to develop as a person. As such I look forward to any correspondence this site is able to bring! See you around!
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,
Kevin Andersson
