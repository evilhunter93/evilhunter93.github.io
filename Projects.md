	  <p> While being a collection of disparate tasks rather than a project, 
	  I think it's important to note the different languages you've had experiences with,
	  as having encountered several languages (and language types) gives a wider understanding of programming overall.
	  This was a course I attended with a classmate and friend, and while the language at first felt quite unusual 
	  (I am more experienced with object-oriented programming), it was also really fun to learn.
	  In fact, part of the reason for the fun was that it was weird!
