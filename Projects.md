<h1>My work</h1>
<p>
  On this page I will list various projects/assignments I've completed, be it in a workplace, in class or during my free time.
  Each project assignment will be accompanied by a description giving some minor details about my experience with the project, 
  as well as why I deem it to be important to include in this page.

	  <h3>Implementing and using monte-carlo testing for the game Tak</h3>
	  <p>Collaborators: Ludvig Rappe, Samuel Johansson</p>
	  <p>Period: March 23rd 2017 to June 30th, 2017 
	  <p>This was a half-year project aimed at creating a basic implementation
	  of the game <a class="tt" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tak_(game)">Tak <span class="ttt">To Tak on Wikipedia</span></a>, as well as
	  a learning ai, which should be able to utilize several learning algorithms to get better at playing Tak.
	  The learning algorithms used were monte-carlo and min-max evaluation 
	  (I take the best option, the opponent will take for me the worst option).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  The takeaways from this project, aside from the obvious of learning to create a basic learning AI, was first and foremost
	  the extended experience of using c#. Before this point, I had mostly used c# for smaller assignments or smaller unity projects.

	  <h3>Making databases using sqlite</h3>
	  <p>Collaborators:<br>Modeling:Sebastian Karabeleski, Lisa Claesson<br>Implementation:None</p>
	  <p>Period: February 19th 2017 to May 5th 2017
	  <p>
	    This was quite an interesting project! 
		We were to work in teams with modeling and implementing a database based on the requirements of a client, KrustyKookies. 
		As you might assume, KrustyKookies is not a real thing! 
		Anyhow, one thing lead to another, the team split up and I ended up having to do the implementation on my own. 
		It was quite demanding to do the implementation by myself, but things finally worked out!
      </p>
	  <p>
	  What I learned from this project was not only to implement a database using sqlite, but also to model one based
	  on the description of an existing system, which I personally would deem to be the more valuable lesson.

	  <h3>Creating a fire-extinguisher simulator with Hololens</h3>
	  <p>Collaborators: Rasmus Hallevåg, Alexander Christerson Westerberg</p>
	  <p>Period: April 18th 2018 to May 31st 2018
	  <p>This was an awesome project, performed over the span of four months. The assignment was to create an application
	  which took extensive use of virtual/augmented reality. What we chose to do was as you might have guessed a fire-fighting simulator
	  using the Hololens. The implementation was realized in Unity.</p>
	  <p>
	  What I took away from this project was a lot more knowledge about working in Unity, 
	  and also working with a component that has less than optimal documentation. 
	  After all, the hololens was relatively new and all the tools and scripts were constantly being updated. 
	  So that was something we had to get around!
