<h1>My work</h1>
<p>
  On this page I will list various projects/assignments I've completed, be it in a workplace, in class or during my free time.
  Each project assignment will be accompanied by a description giving some minor details about my experience with the project, as well as why I deem it to be important to include in this page.

	  <h3>Implementing and using monte-carlo testing for the game Tak</h3>
	  <p>Collaborators:Ludvig Rappe, Samuel Johansson</p>
	  <p>This was a half-year project aimed at creating a basic implementation
	  of the game <a class="tt">Tak <span class="ttt">To Tak on Wikipedia</span></a>, as well as
	  a learning ai, which should be able to utilize several learning algorithms to get better at playing Tak.
	  The learning algorithms used were monte-carlo and min-max evaluation 
	  (I take the best option, the opponent will take for me the worst option).

	  <h3>Making databases using sqlite</h3>
	  <p>Collaborators: </p>
	  <p>
	    This was quite an interesting project! 
		We were to work in teams with modeling and implementing a database based on the requirements of a client, KrustyKookies. 
		As you might assume, KrustyKookies is not a real thing! 
		Anyhow, one thing lead to another, the team split up and I ended up having to do the implementation on my own. 
		It was quite demanding to do the implementation by myself, but things finally worked out!
