<h1>My work</h1>
<p>
  On this page I will list various projects/assignments I've completed, be it in a workplace, in class or during my free time.
  Each project assignment will be accompanied by a description giving some minor details about my experience with the project, as well as why I deem it to be important to include in this page.

	  <h3>Programming Haskell</h3>
	  <p>
	  While being a collection of disparate tasks rather than a project, 
	  I think it's important to note the different languages you've had experiences with,
	  as having encountered several languages (and language types) gives a wider understanding of programming overall.
	  This was a course I attended with a classmate and friend, and while the language at first felt quite unusual 
	  (I am more experienced with object-oriented programming), it was also really fun to learn.
	  In fact, part of the reason for the fun was that it was weird!

	  <h3>Making databases using sqlite</h3>
	  <p>
	    This was quite an interesting project! 
		We were to work in teams with modeling and implementing a database based on the requirements of a client, KrustyKookies. 
		As you might assume, KrustyKookies is not a real thing! 
		Anyhow, one thing lead to another, the team split up and I ended up having to do the implementation on my own. 
		It was quite demanding to do the implementation by myself, but things finally worked out!
